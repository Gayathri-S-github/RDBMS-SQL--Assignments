2. Populate the DEPT table with data from the DEPARTMENTS table. Include only columns that
   you need.

	INSERT INTO dept
	SELECT department_id, department_name

	Column Name 	ID 	LAST_NAME 	FIRST_NAME 	DEPT_ID
	Key Type
	Nulls/Unique
	FK Table
	FK Column
	Data type 	Number 	VARCHAR2 	VARCHAR2 	Number
	Length 		7 	25 		25		 7	

	CREATE TABLE emp
	(id NUMBER(7),
	last_name VARCHAR2(25),
	first_name VARCHAR2(25),
	dept_id NUMBER(7));
	
	DESCRIBE emp

4. Modify the EMP table to allow for longer employee last names. Confirm your modification.

	ALTER TABLE emp
	MODIFY (last_name VARCHAR2(50));

	DESCRIBE emp

5. Confirm that both the DEPT and EMP tables are stored in the data dictionary. (Hint:
   USER_TABLES)
	
	SELECT table_name
	FROM user_tables
	WHERE table_name IN (’DEPT’, ’EMP’);

	SELECT employee_id id, first_name, last_name, salary,
	department_id dept_id
	FROM employees;

7. Drop the EMP table.

	DROP TABLE emp;

8. Rename the EMPLOYEES2 table to EMP.

	RENAME employees2 TO emp;

9. Add a comment to the DEPT and EMP table definitions describing the tables. Confirm your
   additions in the data dictionary.
   COMMENT ON TABLE emp IS ’Employee Information’;
   COMMENT ON TABLE dept IS ’Department Information’;

	SELECT *
	FROM user_tab_comments
	WHERE table_name = ’DEPT’
	OR table_name = ’EMP’;

10. Drop the FIRST_NAME column from the EMP table. Confirm your modification by checking the

	ALTER TABLE emp
	DROP COLUMN FIRST_NAME;
	
	DESCRIBE emp

11. In the EMP table, mark the DEPT_ID column in the EMP table as UNUSED. Confirm your

	ALTER TABLE emp
	SET UNUSED (dept_id);

	DESCRIBE emp
